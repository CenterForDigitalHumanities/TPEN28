The Transcription for Paleographical and Editorial Notation (T‑PEN) project is coordinated by the Center for Digital Theology at Saint Louis University (SLU) and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the NEH. The Electronic Norman Anonymous Project developed several abilities at the core of this project's functionality.

T‑PEN is released under ECL v.2.0 as free and open-source software (git), the primary instance of which is maintained by SLU at T‑PEN.org.

## TOOLS
T‑PEN will continue to add tools for transcription as regular feature releases. Please contact us if you would like to see a particular tool integrated with the transcription interface.
